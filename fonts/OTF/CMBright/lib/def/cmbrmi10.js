/*
 *  cmbrmi10/def.js
 *
 *  This file loads the cmbrmi10 font into jsMath. To do this use
 *
 *      <SCRIPT>jsMath.Font.Load("cmbrmi10")</SCRIPT>
 *
 *  after loading jsMath.js itself.  The user will need to have
 *  the cmbrmi10.ttf font installed, otherwise corresponding unicode
 *  characters will be used, but the mapping is not perfect, and it is not
 *  customized on a per-browser basis as it probably should be.
 *
 *  If the font isn't installed, the user will receive a message indicating
 *  that fact, and pointing to the jsMath web site where the font can be
 *  downloaded.
 *
 *  Once this file is loaded, you can use \char{cmbrmi10}{nn} to access
 *  any character in the font.  In addition, the \cmbrmi10 macro will switch to
 *  the eufm font
